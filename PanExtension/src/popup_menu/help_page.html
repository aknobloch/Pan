		<div class="accordion-panel">
		  <p>Pan works by analyzing the pages that you visit for sources, then replacing mentions of those sources with links to their Wikipedia page.
		  	For privacy (and performance) reasons, Pan will only monitor the pages that you tell it to. <b>In order to add a website to this list, simply click
		  	the "Add Current Site" button in the main menu.</b> You can remove sites through the "Manage All Sites" button.
		</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">About Pan</button>
		<div class="accordion-panel">
		  <p>Pan is made by a single developer, and uses a number of different technologies. To learn more information about Pan, the source code, or its creator,
		  	you can visit <a href="https://github.com/aknobloch">GitHub</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Privacy Policy</button>
		<div class="accordion-panel">
		  <p>Pan takes data privacy very seriously. The information collected by our server is simply the article URL and the content of the page. <b>This information is not tied back to you, as a user, in any form, nor is this data shared with anyone.</b> If you are concerned with the 
		  accuracy of these statements, you can contact the creator via the Support and Feedback option.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Support &amp; Feedback</button>
		<div class="accordion-panel">
		  <p>Since Pan was made by a singular developer, support and updates might be slow. If you'd like to contact the creator for feedback or support, you can 
		  	send an <a href="mailto:aarondevelops@gmail.com?subject=Pan%20Support%20">email</a>. If you'd like to contribute to the project, you can visit the
		  	creator on <a href="https://github.com/aknobloch">GitHub</a>.</p>
