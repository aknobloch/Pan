# What is Pan?
In the age of information and big data, it has become nearly impossible for any conscientious consumer to keep their facts straight. Whether reading news, sports, tabloids or research papers, the amount of information presented to people on a daily basis is utterly overwhelming.

This is where Pan comes in. Pan is a browser extension aimed at providing easy access to subjects and sources. 

### What can Pan do?
In short, Pan will do the research for you. As you surf the internet, Pan will analyze the pages you allow it to using state-of-the-art machine learning. In doing so, it will identify the subjects of what you are reading and find any corresponding Wikipedia pages for those subjects. After it has gathered this information, Pan will replace mentions of those subjects with their relevant links.  

# How do I use Pan?
To use Pan, simply install the browser add-on from the Chrome, Firefox or Opera store.

### Does Pan collect my data?
Pan takes data privacy very seriously. In order to function, Pan must observe your web browsing and send it to our server for analysis. However, this process is entirely anonymous. **The information collected by our server is simply the article URL and the content of the page. This information is not tied back to you, as a user, in any form, nor is this data shared with anyone. Period.**

### How can I help?
If you would like to contribute to Pan, please refer to the contribution and developer setup documentation.
