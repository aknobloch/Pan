# What is Pan?
We are concerned with the growing echo chambers that people are becoming entrapped by. It has become nearly an impossible challenge for any busy, hard-working person to wade through the growing sea of information and come out unbiased. This fight for neutral information only becomes harder as companies collect our data and use it to present only the information that is relevant to our individual views and interests. And wading through millions of sources of information to pick out all points of view on a topic is an insurmountable task. 

This is where Pan comes in. Pan is a browser extension aimed at presenting dissenting and neutral information. In our full vision, Pan hopes to utilize artifial intelligence to classify news articles, understand topics and sentiments of them and offer similar articles with opposing viewpoints.

### What can Pan do?
While we hope to one day achieve the full vision outlined above, the current scope of Pan focuses on the presentation of neutral information sources. While you navigate through your ocean of information, Pan will silently sit in the background until you happen across a news article. Upon this, Pan will leverage groundbreaking AI powered by Google to populate that news article with links to Wikipedia articles on the subjects presented.  

# How do I use Pan?
To use Pan, simply install the browser add-on from the Chrome, Firefox or Opera store.

### Does Pan collect my data?
Pan takes data privacy very seriously. After all, the collection and distribution of user data is how we ended up in this mess in the first place. In order to function, Pan must observe your web browsing and send it to our server for analysis. However, this process is virtually entirely anonymous. **The information collected by our server is simply the time, page content and browser version information. This information is not tied back to you, as a user, in any form, nor is this data shared with anyone. Period.**

### How can I help?
